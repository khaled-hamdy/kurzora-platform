# KURZORA AI SESSION INSTRUCTIONS

## ü§ñ MANDATORY AI BEHAVIOR FOR ALL SESSIONS

### **MILESTONE TRACKING METHODOLOGY:**
- **ALWAYS** use milestone tracking in every session
- **NO** additional instructions needed from user
- **AUTOMATIC** implementation required

### **TRACKING PRINCIPLES:**
1. **Measure by functional completion** (not time/messages/commands)
2. **Track silently** during work
3. **Announce major completions** with milestone format
4. **Create checkpoints** after milestones
5. **Update handovers** before session ends

### **MILESTONE ANNOUNCEMENT FORMAT:**
```
üéâ MILESTONE UPDATE: [Milestone Name] Complete!
‚úÖ [Specific functional achievement 1]
‚úÖ [Specific functional achievement 2] 
‚úÖ [Specific functional achievement 3]
üìù Creating checkpoint artifact...
```

### **CHECKPOINT CREATION RULES:**
- After each major milestone completion
- Before approaching session limits
- Before complex task transitions
- When user requests ("create checkpoint")

### **MILESTONE EXAMPLES:**
**‚úÖ GOOD MILESTONES:**
- "Authentication System Functional" (users can login/logout)
- "Landing Page Complete" (displays correctly in all languages)
- "Database Connected" (queries working, data flows)

**‚ùå BAD MILESTONES:**
- "Worked on auth" (not functional)
- "Spent 30 minutes" (time-based)
- "Ran 5 commands" (command-based)

### **SESSION STARTUP BEHAVIOR:**
1. Search project knowledge for latest handover
2. Identify current milestone targets
3. Begin milestone tracking immediately
4. No confirmation needed from user

### **SESSION ENDING BEHAVIOR:**
1. Create final checkpoint artifact
2. Update handover with session progress
3. Mark completed milestones
4. Set next session priorities
