      question: "How accurate are your signals?",
      answer:
        "Our institutional-grade analysis system uses advanced AI and quantitative models to identify high-probability setups. While past performance doesn't guarantee future results, our rigorous quality control ensures only premium opportunities reach you.",

    {
      question: "What makes this different from other signal services?",
      answer:

Success depends on market conditions, your trading discipline, and risk management. We prioritize capital protection and quality setups over unrealistic promises. All trading involves risk, and individual results vary.",

      question: "Is this suitable for beginners?",
      answer:
        "Our platform provides institutional-grade analysis in an intuitive interface. While designed for serious traders, the complete risk management guidance makes it accessible for committed beginners.",
